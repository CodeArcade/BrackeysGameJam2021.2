"Hey, it's Mike from accounting. Do you have any plans for lunch? I was thinking that maybe we could check out that new italian place.
What was it called again? Tony's? Little John's? I can't remember. Anyways, if you wanna join me, just come over to my desk. See ya later!"

### McDogs

"Hey, it's Mike from accounting. Before I worked here I had a pretty bad fast food job. The day that I quit was especially bad. I spent 15 minutes trying to explain to an old man that we do not sell hot dogs (McDogs as he called them) and then he threatened to report me for "withholding products from him". Anyways, all I wanted to say is that I'm making hot dogs later, so if you want any, scoot on over. See ya later pal"

## Bettys Dialogue

### Betty is checking in

"Hey, Betty from HR! Just checking in that you're still employed and well... alive. teehee. Byebyee"

### Murder Mystery

"Hey, Betty here. Say, do you like party games? I came up with a fun one. It's a reverse murder mystery called 'who the hell reanimated this person?'.
All the players are assassins and they have to figure out who reanimated the person, because that means there is someone out there who can get first-hand accounts of them.
Wanna come over and play? You can be the corpse if you want 😉"

### Pentagrams

"Hey, it's Betty! I was bored yesterday and decided to draw a bunch of pentagrams on a contract. I ended up with at least 100 of them, but before I could draw any more, a devilish-looking guy wearing a red suit broke down the door of the classroom and yelled "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?!". Then he snatched the contract, somehow burned it without a lighter and ran away. I will never stop thinking about that man."

### Time traveler

"I had a dream I was able to time travel and went like 10 million years into the future, but the INSTANT I went to the year 4000 I got stuck in a time dilation jail
set up by the american government in the year 3877. Everyone who tried to time travel back or forth across May 23, 3877 while on Earth would end up stuck in this 
time dilation chamber trap to stop time travelers. But like, it was so crazy and mismanaged because it was legit capturing like every single time traveler ever
and the place had only been open for 12 minutes and was already getting overpopulated with nonstop multople recursive instances of this one guy trying to break previous versions of himself out of this time traveler jail. Crazy times, I tell ya"

### Tired

"When I was in middle school, our teachers told us that you can't 'make up' hors of sleep after not getting enough, and I thought that meant if I didn't get enough sleep one night I would be tired for the rest of my life... And then I was. Remember to go to sleep kiddo."

### bananas

"OH MY GOD! Apparently artificial banana flavoring is based on the gros michel banana, which was wiped out by a banana plague in the 50s. The banana we eat today is a completely different thing calld 'The cavendish' and thats why banana candy doesn't taste like bananas. DO YOU KNOW how lied to I feel. Like, there was a BANANA APOCALYPSE and no one told me about it until now."

### library

"Did you know? The local library doesn't have a maximum book checkout limit and I am about to make them regret this. You need anything?"
