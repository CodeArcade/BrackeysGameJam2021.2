# Dialogue

## Mr. Bossmans Dialogue

### Work harder

"Hey, new guy! Are you working enough? ... Well, work harder!"
I'm thinking that the boss calls and uses this voice line when the player has too many docs on his desk

### Work less?

"Hey, new guy! Betty told me that you were working hard... you can slow down if you want. JUST KIDDING, WORK HARDER!"

### Mike?

"Hey, new guy! Have you seen Mike around? You know, Mike from Accounting. He skipped 3 days of work already and I think I'll have to fire him..."

## Mikes Dialogue

### Mike want's to go to dinner

"Hey, it's Mike from accounting. Do you have any plans for lunch? I was thinking that maybe we could check out that new italian place.
What was it called again? Tony's? Little John's? I can't remember. Anyways, if you wanna join me, just come over to my desk. See ya later!"

### McDogs

"Hey, it's Mike from accounting. Before I worked here I had a pretty bad fast food job. The day that I quit was especially bad. I spent 15 minutes trying to explain to an old man that we do not sell hot dogs (McDogs as he called them) and then he threatened to report me for "withholding products from him". Anyways, all I wanted to say is that I'm making hot dogs later, so if you want any, scoot on over. See ya later pal"

## Bettys Dialogue

### Betty is checking in

"Hey, Betty from HR! Just checking in that you're still employed and well... alive. teehee. Byebyee"

### Murder Mystery

"Hey, Betty here. Say, do you like party games? I came up with a fun one. It's a reverse murder mystery called 'who the hell reanimated this person?'.
All the players are assassins and they have to figure out who reanimated the person, because that means there is someone out there who can get first-hand accounts of them.
Wanna come over and play? You can be the corpse if you want 😉"

### Pentagrams

"Hey, it's Betty! I was bored yesterday and decided to draw a bunch of pentagrams on a contract. I ended up with at least 100 of them, but before I could draw any more, a devilish-looking guy wearing a red suit broke down the door of my office and yelled "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?!". Then he snatched the contract, somehow burned it without a lighter and ran away. I will never stop thinking about that man."

## Vlads Dialogue

### Vlad introduces himself

"Hello. Vlad from IT here. You're phone working OK? If you get mail for vlad, just forward it to him. Might be Uranium. XAXAXA! Ok, we talk later."

### Salamanders

### Car Alarms

"Hello. It is vlad talking. Have you noticed that nobody hears car alarm and thinks 'Oh. Car is being stolen'. They only think 'I hope car gets stolen faster, sound is annoying'. So anyway... You need car?"

### Vlad wants to help you

"Hello. vlad from IT. Everything alright? Is Mike bothering you? Don't worry, I got you. Don't say word. I will make it stop. do svidaniya".

### Someone come get my trash

"Is this Irigatex corporation? You guys were supposed to come and get my trash 4 days ago! Do you have any idea how much hecking trash is lying around here?
It smells like a dump. But this ain't a dump. My house is not where my trash belongs. So you better get your guys movin', I'm drowing in garbage!"


### I.C. Wiener

"Hi, I'm calling to talk to a Mr. Wiener, first name initials 'I.C.'? You could call for them like this: 'IS THERE A MR. I SEE WIENER AROUND? I SEE WIENER?' HEHEHE"

### Time traveler

"I had a dream I was able to time travel and went like 10 million years into the future, but the INSTANT I went to the year 4000 I got stuck in a time dilation jail
set up by the american government in the year 3877. Everyone who tried to time travel back or forth across May 23, 3877 while on Earth would end up stuck in this 
time dilation chamber trap to stop time travelers. But like, it was so crazy and mismanaged because it was legit capturing like every single time traveler ever
and the place had only been open for 12 minutes and was already getting overpopulated with nonstop multople recursive instances of this one guy trying to break previous versions of himself out of this time traveler jail. Crazy times, I tell ya"

### Tired

"When I was in middle school, our teachers told us that you can't 'make up' hors of sleep after not getting enough, and I thought that meant if I didn't get enough sleep one night I would be tired for the rest of my life... And then I was. Remember to go to sleep kiddo."

### bananas

"OH MY GOD! Apparently artificial banana flavoring is based on the gros michel banana, which was wiped out by a banana plague in the 50s. The banana we eat today is a completely different thing calld 'The cavendish' and thats why banana candy doesn't taste like bananas. DO YOU KNOW how lied to I feel. Like, there was a BANANA APOCALYPSE and no one told me about it until now."

### library

"Did you know? The local library doesn't have a maximum book checkout limit and I am about to make them regret this. You need anything?"

## Actually relevant Dialogue

### Mr Bossman

#### Intro to the Job

1. "Hey there new guy, this is your boss speaking. I thought I'd give you a quick rundown on how your job actually works."
2. "It's rather simple. You get documents, you sort them. Done deal."
3. "First: this is a contract. You can read them if you want, but for now, just put them in the blue bin."
4. "Next, this is a paycheck. It's just a regular paycheck. It's got a date, it's got the amount and the department. You can also just toss it into the blue bin."
5. "This is an application. It's from the people that will replace you one day. HAHAHA just kidding. Just put them in the red bin."
6. "Now, this is just a regular letter. Nothing special about it. Just put them in the green bin."
7. "Now this... this is classified. Don't open it. Just throw it in the trash! I mean... I can't stop you from opening it as you throw it away anyways... Well just don't!"
8. "Alright, that's about everything. If there are any new rules, people will call you to inform you about it. So don't hang up on them all willy nilly. And now go to work!"

#### I'm a proud boy

"New guy, are you working hard? Well I hope you do. I know, I only told you what to do earlier today, but you gotta change things up a bit, right? Well, I'm calling about applications. I want you to toss all applications of people that are **not** from America. Got it? No foreigners!"

#### No more racism... or something like that

"Alright alright, I changed my mind. Foreigners aren't that bad. At least some of them! From now on, I only need you to toss applications from people coming from the following countries:
- Denmark
- Sweden
- Norway
- Finland
- United Kingdom
Also, you gotta make sure that they list an existing country! No people from 'this-aint-real-istan!"

### Betty

#### fuck men, but not literally

"Hey rookie! This is Betty. You know, from HR. Listen, I have some new rules for you. Now, we get lot's of applications. But we don't need that many, right? So, until further notice, just toss all applications sent by men! Don't worry, the Boss approved it. Alright, talk to you later!"

#### why does no one know how letters work

"Hey sweetheart. So, about 50 letters in the last week arrived without any stamps and return addresses, so we couldn't send them out. From now on, please make sure that every letter has a stamp and a return address on it. Thanks dear!"

#### paycheck departments

"If I could I'd kill every single stupid braindead monkey from accounting. NONE OF THE CHECKS I RECEIVED TODAY hat a department listed on them. So from now on, when you get a paycheck, please confirm that there is a department on it and that it is a valid one."

### Mike

#### Signed Contracts

"Hey, it's Mike! So, I recently got a contract that you sorted... but whoever gave it to you didn't sign it. So from now on, check if contracts are signed before passing them on."

#### Paycheck

"Hello, it's mike! For one reason or another I don't seem to be getting any paychecks. You're putting them in the red organizer, right? Well if you don't, you better start doing it."
